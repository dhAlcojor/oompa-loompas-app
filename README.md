# oompa-loompas-app

Android native app to help with the management of Oompa Loompas

## Features

### Retrieve Oompa Loompas data from a REST endpoint

This simple app lists the Oompa Loompas received from the
endpoint https://2q2woep105.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/napptilus/oompa-loompas

This is done using Retrofit2 and Mochi and the data is cached locally.

When running the app in debug mode, Http requests are logged in to Logcat.

### Display the list of Oompa Loompas

The app makes use of the Jetpack Compose API and uses some Material3 experimental features.
